## Description

TaskMaster Pro is a demonstration of a complete client-side application. It focuses on clean UI, intuitive functionality, and data persistence. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, filter their view to see pending or completed items, and delete tasks they no longer need. All data is saved in the browser's local storage.

## Key Features

* **Data Persistence:** Uses the browser's `localStorage` to save all tasks, so the user's data is not lost on page reload or browser exit.
* **Full CRUD Operations:** Implements core application logic for creating, reading, updating (toggling completion), and deleting tasks.
* **Client-Side Filtering:** Allows users to filter their task list to view "All", "Completed", or "Pending" items, all handled efficiently on the client-side.
* **Clean & Responsive UI:** The interface is designed to be modern, easy to use, and fully responsive for a seamless experience on any device.
